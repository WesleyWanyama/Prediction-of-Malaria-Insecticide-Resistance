                        ranking. FAST algorithm to find consensus
                        (median) ranking defined by Amodio, D'Ambrosio
                        and Siciliano (2016). It returns at least one
                        of the solutions. If there are multiple
                        solutions, sometimes it returns all the
                        solutions, sometimes it returns some solutions,
                        always it returns at least one solution.
